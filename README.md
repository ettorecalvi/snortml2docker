# snortml2docker
This is an experimental configuration of Snort3 integrating SnortML, a machine-learning-based module designed to detect and respond to unknown exploits by training a custom model. In this repository, you will find all the resources necessary to build and deploy the model . This setup follows Dr.Brandon Stultzâ€™s SQL injection example.
